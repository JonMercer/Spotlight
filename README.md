# Overview

Spotlight is a location based image sharing iOS app that shows images that others have posted around you. It is done completely with Swift and Firebase. 

We created a NoSQL architecture to efficiently query for images around the user, handling all of the location based retrival on the client side iOS device.


## Setup: installing Cocoapods

- Delete "Spotlight.xcworkspace" if you already have it

- `pod install` 20 seconds
